# ntexup Documentation Slides

This repository contains presentation slides that showcase and document the capabilities of ntexup — a text-based, developer-friendly presentation tool for academics, researchers, and technical communicators.

**ntexup** is an open-source, text-based document and presentation generator designed to make the creation of professional, math-heavy, and reusable teaching materials effortless.

It is built on **Java**, **Nuts**, and **TSON**, combining the simplicity of Markdown with the power of LaTeX and the flexibility of template-driven document generation — all while being version-control friendly.
